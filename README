SmartInstallationManager is a Python program that (if set as a cron) will automatically scan the ~/.bash_history file for installed packeges. It keeps a running total of these file so that at a later time you can re-install them (this program actually does this too!)

Tested (t) and Currently Supported (s) OSes:
Ubuntu 12.04		ts (Should work for other Ubuntu distros or derivatives using: apt-get install, /etc/issues, and ~/.bash_history


Usage:

SmartInstMan.py [-i | -u] -- With no flags, it reads the config file "smartinst.conf" (if it doesn't exist, it will be automatically creates and parses the history file looking for installed package names and storing them in "smartpack.lst"
		   -i     -- Installs all files listed in "smartpack.lst"
		   -u	  -- Does an update of "smartpack.lst" as described above.

The flags --install and --update can be used instead of -i and -u respectively.
